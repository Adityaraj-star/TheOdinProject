    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A burger, or hamburger, is a sandwich made of a cooked patty, between a bun or roll. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>For the Patty:</li>

        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs (whole wheat or regular)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped bell pepper (any color)</li>
        <li>1-2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chili powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg (or a flax egg for a vegan option: 1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tbsp water)</li>

    </ul>
    <li>For the Assembly:</li>
    <ul tpye="square">
        <li>Burger buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Onion slices (raw or grilled)</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or other condiments</li>
    </ul>
    

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li> Prepare the Patty Mixture</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash the Beans: In a large bowl, mash the black beans with a fork or potato masher, leaving some chunks for texture.</li>
            <li>Mix Ingredients: Add the cooked quinoa, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, bell pepper, garlic, cumin, chili powder (if using), salt, pepper, and egg (or flax egg). Mix until well combined. If the mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs until it holds together.</li>
            <li>Chill the Mixture: Cover the mixture and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to help the patties firm up.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Form the Patties</li>
        <ol>
            <li>After chilling, divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each into a patty about ¾ inch thick.</li>
        </ol>
        <li> Preheat the Grill or Pan</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, add a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Cook the Patties</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Patties: Once the grill or pan is hot, place the patties on it. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on one side.</li>
            <li>Flip and Cook: Carefully flip the patties and cook for another 4-5 minutes until they are heated through and slightly crispy on the outside. If using cheese, add a slice on top during the last minute of cooking and cover with a lid to melt.</li>

        </ol>
        <li>Toast the Buns (Optional)</li>
        <ol>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, toast the burger buns on the grill or in a separate skillet for 1-2 minutes until lightly golden.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Assemble the Burger</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Bottom Bun: Start with the bottom half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Add Lettuce: Place a leaf of lettuce on the bun.</li>
            <li>Add the Patty: Place the cooked veggie patty on top of the lettuce.</li>
            <li>Layer Other Toppings: Add tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and any other toppings you like.</li>
            <li>Condiments: Spread your favorite condiments on the top half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Top Bun: Place the top half of the bun on top to finish your burger.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Serve</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Serve the veggie burgers immediately with fries, chips, or a salad on the side. Enjoy!</li>
