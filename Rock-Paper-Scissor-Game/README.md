# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
Rock Paper Scissors Game
This project is a simple implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project curriculum. It is a console-based game where the player competes against the computer in a best-of-five match.

This my first JS project.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. JS

What I Learned
Working on this project helped me practice and solidify the following concepts:

1. JavaScript Fundamentals:
Using variables, conditionals, and loops to implement game logic.
2. Functions and Modularity:
Breaking down the game into smaller, reusable functions like getComputerChoice() and playRound().
3. Math.random():
Generating random values to simulate the computer's choice.
4. User Input Handling:
Using the prompt() function to take input from the player.
5. Basic Debugging:
Testing the game logic, fixing errors, and improving the overall flow.
