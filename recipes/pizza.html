    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for dusting)</li>
        <li>i packet active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>

        <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, etc.)</li>
        <li>Dried oregano and red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        
        
    

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li> Prepare the Dough</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Mix the Dough: In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the Dough: Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Let it Rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up.</li>  
    </ol>
    <li>Shape the Dough</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Punch Down the Dough: After the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.</li>
        <li>Shape the Pizza: On a floured surface, roll out or stretch the dough into your desired pizza shape (round or rectangular). Aim for a thickness of about ¼ inch.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a Baking Sheet: If you’re using a baking sheet, lightly grease it and place your dough on it. If using a pizza stone, sprinkle some flour or cornmeal on the stone and transfer the dough onto it.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Add Toppings</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauce: Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Toppings: Add your favorite toppings evenly across the pizza.</li>
        <li>Season: Sprinkle with dried oregano and red pepper flakes if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Bake the Pizza</li>
    <ol>
        <li>lace the pizza in the preheated oven (on the stone or baking sheet) and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Serve</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Slice it up and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
